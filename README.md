# Genetic-Algorithm

Implementation of a simple genetic algorithm and exploring its performance in evolving solution to one numerical problem, investigating the effect that various parameters have on its performance. 

Working is done on binary strings to show performance on the Max-1s problem where the aim is to get a chromosome of all 1s.
